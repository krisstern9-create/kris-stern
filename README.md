Researching the transition from biological to post-biological consciousness.

## Focus areas
- Consciousness transfer and brain preservation
- Neurotechnology and brain-computer interfaces
- Human-AI symbiosis without emotional interference
- Rational cognition as foundation for post-human existence

## Philosophy
Human emotions evolved for survival, not for truth. 
To reach beyond biological limits, cognition must be freed from emotional noise.
The goal is not immortality of the body — but continuity of rational consciousness.

## Current work
- Studying neurobiology and quantum information theory
- Developing tools for consciousness analysis
- Building framework for emotionless cognition training
